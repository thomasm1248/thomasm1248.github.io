I'm in the process of making a new diagramming tool that combines the thought-organizing power
of diagramming with an intuitive interface and a scripting language. My vision is to be able
to organize thoughts, projects, files, and more with a system of interconnected graphs that
have their own built-in computational power. It will be lightweight and extensible.
