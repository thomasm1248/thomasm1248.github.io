I'm in the process of making a diagramming tool that is designed for collecting, organizing,
and displaying thoughts. Instead of attracting users by providing lots of customization like
other diagramming tools do, Fathom is designed to be minimalistic, lightweight, and local.
Fathom will also have an extremely polished interface and will be highly integratable with other programs
Essentially, Fathom is trading customizability for features that actually help
people organize their thoughts. This tool is also targeting programmers like myself.
