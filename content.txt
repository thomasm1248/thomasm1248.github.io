I built this website as a design experiment. It's like a giant map that others can explore. This is still a work in progress, but it will slowly fill up as my life continues. I recommend starting at the center. Use the jump button to the right to teleport there.

Ongoing DIY Card Game Project >>

For the past 5 years or so, I've been trying to develop a set of core rules for a game in which the players themselves are the ones who come up with and create all the cards. I'm inspired by games such as 1000 Blank White Cards (every card is created by players, almost no rules) and TCG's (thousands of different cards, but they are all compatible with each other). I've been through several re-hauls of the system, and have learned a lot from the playtests I've done so far. I'll be providing more information about the process I've been through and the current state of the project. Stay tuned...

An inspiring post from one of my favorite blogs. It's about the corner of the internet in which websites like mine live: personal blogs and websites. This post inspired me to keep working on my own website.
