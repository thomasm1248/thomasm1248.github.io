This is an easy-to-use tool for sorting through large amounts of images on your computer. It's not very feature-packed, but it does one thing well: quickly sorting pictures into two bins.

To use this tool, you'll choose an input folder, and two output folders. You'll then start the sorting process. Each image will be displayed to you, and you can sort it into one output folder by pressing the up arrow and into the other output folder by pressing the down arrow. If you change your mind about a decision you made, you can always press the left arrow to return to a previous image. After looking through all the images, you'll confirm that you're ready for your changes to be made final by pressing the ENTER key. 

You can use this tool for deciding which pictures to keep and which to throw away, which pictures you want to keep in an album and which you want to move to another album, and any other purpose you can think of. 

## Running the tool

In the command line, type the following command:

```
python <path to image-thresher.py>
```

Use the GUI to select the input and output folders, then start the sorting process.
