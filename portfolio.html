    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 10px">I'm very reflective and focused, and I'm constantly looking for ways things could be done better. Writing software that helps others be more productive is my #1 goal as a professional.</p>

<!-- Professional Experience -->
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Experience</h2>

<h3>Software Developer - NC Software Solutions</h3>
<p>I worked through a backlog of bugs in a .NET WPF application. I was primarily focused on improving the user experience by solving UI issues and adding features that made common tasks easier. A few months ago, I was asked to build an OPC UA server in C++ on my own, which I'm currently almost finished with.</p>

<h3>Math and Computer Science Tutor - Southern Utah University</h3>
<p>I met with struggling students, helping them fill in the gaps of their understanding, and pushing them to develop their problem solving skills. This required me to regularly review course material from a variety of math and CS classes I had taken previously. I also had to learn to be very comfortable giving and receiving help from other tutors, because the accuracy of the answers given to students was much more important than pride.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>File Steward</h3>
<p>Frustrated with the amount of time I was spending managing files on my computer, I built <a href="https://github.com/thomasm1248/file-steward">File Steward</a>, which automates many of the tasks I was spending so much time on. This tool has reduced a series of tasks that used to take about 30 minutes total to a short routine that only takes a few minutes.</p>

<h3>Image Thresher</h3>
<p>One of my brothers needed a way to sort through thousands of pictures on his computer and quickly decide which to keep and which to throw out. In a spare evening, I built <a href="https://github.com/thomasm1248/image-thresher">Image Thresher</a> using Python, which displays the images one after another, allowing the user to decide their fate with a single press of a button.</p>

<!-- Leadership Section -->
<div class="black-section">
    <h2>Leadership Qualities</h2>
    <p>I like to stay focused, and I help others stay focused by asking them questions that will help us all clarify what problems we need to solve, how we're going to solve them, and what actions we're going to take next. I believe one of the major obstacles to getting things done as a team is team members not knowing what to do or how to contribute. Asking team members these clarifying questions invites them to participate in the planning process, enabling their participation going forward.</p>

<!-- Elevator Speech -->
<h2>Fathom - A New Way To Get Organized</h2>
<p>I aim to help people organize their thoughts, plans, and projects by providing them with a unique diagramming tool built with a focus on minimalism and integrated scripting. After all the projects I've worked on, whether it be for a hobby or for work, I have naturally gravitated towards diagrams because of the way they let me organize ideas and plans in a highly visual way. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed by every diagramming tool I've ever used. Current diagramming tools try to be the end-all-be-all solution by providing every possible feature.</p>
<p>The tool I used to use had enough features to essentially draw any diagram you could think of, but it came with a price: the interface was ugly, cluttered, and confusing. And it didn't provide a way to create any clean and organized diagrams right off the bat. For someone who's trying to make diagrams for other people to look at, that amount of control might actually be useful.</p>
<p>But for me, an individual making simple diagrams for my own reference, I needed a tool that wasn't weighed down by a zoo of features. I needed a tool that was carefully tuned to provide the most stream-lined interface for getting my thoughts out of my head and into a diagram.</p>
<p>That was when I invented Fathom. This diagramming tool is designed to be fast and efficient. One of my primary goals is for Fathom to be able to open a diagram file without any noticable delay. Another goal is for the interface to put all the attention on the diagram without filling valuable screen space with an endless variety of menus. The clean and intuitive interface also avoids the finicky frustration other diagram tools cause by their excess of buttons and pop-ups. To top it all off, Fathom allows users to write small scripts directly in their diagrams that can automate the sorts of calculations that would normally be done in a spreadsheet, which makes Fathom the best choice for managing information and data at a personal level. Overall, Fathom is the best tool for recording, organizing, and structuring ideas and information in an intuitive way.</p>
