I implemented someone else's board game using PHP for a school project. Use at your own risk.

[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOYbR-Q_4Hs) that explains the rules and where the game came from.

[Repository](https://github.com/thomasm1248/tank-turn-tactics) where my implementation can be found.
