# thomasm1248.github.io
This is just a repo I'm using as a website to host all the web programs I make as well as the files they need.  I'll also be using it to store information about my code, as well as links to my GitHub repos.

A small note to all those who view my repos: GitHub shows two people working on my repos (thomasm1248 and creamysoft) when I'm the only one. It's because I've been using two computers but only set my email on one while the other computer was set to my dad's email. I've fixed the problem on 5/15/2016 so it shoudn't happen again.
