<h1>Timeline of my DIY card game</h1>

<p class="date">Last Updated - Jan 3, 2026</p>

<h2>DIYTCG</h2>

<p>I was first trying to make a sort of decentralized TCG. Players would make cards in-between games, and but those cards were "unofficial" because they hadn't been properly ratified into the rest of the game.</p>

<p>The ratification process of new cards happened every time a game was played. The players would decide on a card that they all agreed was a good card, and they would set the card aside as a "trophy". The player that won the game earned the trophy card, and it was ratified into the game, being transformed into an official card.</p>

<p>There were also systems in place for banning unfair cards and for distributing good cards amongst the players so that the winners don't keep all the good cards to themselves.</p>

<h3>Version 1 (playtested)</h3>

<p>This version had a somewhat complex system of card banning that was ugly and required some math and hard-to-remember rules. I discovered this tediousness during the playtest. The playtest also revealed some additional issues:</p>

<ol>
    <li>We were constantly running into weird loopholes, vague situations, and disagreements on how wording of different cards was to be reconciled. It was clear that the game's core rules needed to be more robust.</li>
    <li>The card distribution system left a sour taste in players' mouths because it forced them to part with a card they really liked every now and then.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Version 2</h3>

<p>I made this version much more robust by tightening up the rules and writing a list of clarifications. As for the unpleasant card distribution system, I didn't see a way for it to be fixed, so I decided that it was a necessary evil that simply had to be part of the game in order for the TCG side of things to work alright.</p>

<p>Another major change introduced in this version was that the card banning system was greatly simplified.</p>

<p>At this point, I was realizing that without a large enough community of players, a TCG would simply fizzle out. I decided at this point to set aside my desire to make a TCG, and focus on making a fun game first. After the game got going, I could then re-introduce the TCG systems I had come up with, and make them available as an optional feature that groups of players could implement if desired.</p>

<h2>Dexmod</h2>

<p>Rather than being a TCG, this game was to consist of a single collection of cards owned by one player, who makes all the decisions about which cards to include in the game. This game also came with a bunch of changes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A resource system with 5 types of resource units: Magic, Tech, Wealth, Minions, and Influence. This would provide a more rich system that the cards' effects could tie into.</li>
    <li>A strict policy that cards cannot specify effects that are triggered by other things that happen in the game (I had identified this as the source of many of the confusions and disagreements in the first playtest of DIYTCG).</li>
    <li>Four types of cards: actions (single use), items (keep it in front of you), rules (affects everyone), and events (must be played immediately).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0 (playtested)</h3>

<p>In this version, resources had to be allocated to an item card by the end of your turn or they would be lost. This turned out to be a waste of time because people ended up losing most of their resources. This made the game frustrating to play.</p>

<h3>Version 1.1 (playtested)</h3>

<p>In this version, resources that weren't allocated to item cards were kept in-between turns. Thus, players could either keep their resources on cards, or in their main resource pool. When playtested, it turned out that there wasn't much of a point in allocating resources to a card at all, especially since not all cards wanted resources allocated to them.</p>

<h3>Version 1.2</h3>

<p>In this version, resources were never allocated to cards. Instead, they were simply to be spent at the time they were needed.</p>

<p>I never playtested this version because after drafting the rules, I realized that as long as the resource system was in the game, it was going to feel forced and useless. Even if the cards were updated so that they would make the resources more useful, there would be a frustrating tension between the amount of resources a player needs in order to make use of all their cards, and the actual amount of resources they're getting. I was also annoyed that the resource system was making the game a bit crunchy.</p>

<h3>Version 2</h3>

<p>In this version, I scrapped the whole resource system, and removed event cards. The reason for both of these changes was simply that the value they added to the game wasn't worth the complexity they added.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of the resource system was to provide a more rich game structure that cards could interact with, which was especially necessary due to the policy against triggered effects, I knew I couldn't remove it without replacing it:</p>

<p>The big addition that I brought into the game with v2 was the battle system. Cards could be organized in columns called "platoons", which could then be paired with enemy platoons to form "battles". This allowed cards to be arranged spatially in ways that are not only intuitive to people, but that also provide the cards with a lot of surface area to affect the gameplay through.</p>

<p>This version has yet to be playtested, but I'm very optimistic about it. This could be the final version!</p>
