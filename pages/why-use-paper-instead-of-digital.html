<h1>Use notebooks instead of apps</h1>

<p class="date">August 6, 2025</p>

<p>My goal is that by the end of this short article, you'll be a little more hyped about using a notebook as your primary tool for capturing thoughts and managing your responsibilities, rather than using one of the many productivity apps or to-do list apps.</p>

<p>To begin, I'm actually going to list off some of the reason you might use a digital task management system. First, it's more convenient to move, edit, create, and delete tasks. Second, not only is typing fast, but voice-typing is even faster. Third, since everything else related to your life is probably on your phone, having a digital task system on your phone puts your tasks within a few taps of all the other important apps you use to manage your life.</p>

<p>I will now explain how each of these major reasons for using digital systems actually have hidden consequences.</p>

<h2>The convenience of creating, modifying, scheduling, and deleting tasks</h2>

<p>When I used digital systems to manage my tasks, I noticed that the ease of rescheduling something to another day encouraged me to be more of a procrastinator. As my backlog of avoided tasks grew larger, the complexity of my system had to grow so that I could actually keep track of it all. Productivity became less about doing things, and more about keeping track of countless tasks.</p>

<p>As I've made the switch to a much simpler, paper-based approach, I've noticed that it's much harder to endlessly juggle a hoard of tasks. Whenever I forward something from a previous day to today's to-do list, I have to rewrite it by hand. This forces me to rethink whether I even need to do the task, and how I should word the task so that the way forward will be more clear. I began wanting to do tasks sooner just so that I wouldn't have to keep juggling them with a slow, effortful system. I also noticed that the more I procrastinated a task, the more I had to rewrite it, which made them easier to recall, helping me get them done sooner.</p>

<h2>The speed of typing and speaking</h2>

<p>While typing and voice-typing are certainly convenient, something important is lost in the convenience. It has been well-studied and thoroughly documented that writing things by hand does a better job of placing them more firmly in memory. This is incredibly important because when it really comes down to it, the purpose of a productivity system is to help you remember the right things at the right times. When you write things by hand, you're making it as easy as possible for your brain to recall the things it needs when it needs them.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing that I've picked up on when using notebooks as opposed to my phone is that brains seem to have a particular sense for locations. That is, when we put something somewhere, our brains have adapted to be particularly good at remembering where it is. That's probably because our brains are well-suited for the physical environment where we live. However, when you use digital tools, our brains have a much harder time remembering the location of things. This is because digital tools don't usually try to keep things in the same spot. Digital tools let things move around a lot. But when you use paper, you allow your brain to use its natural abilities to tell you where things are. I frequently find myself suddenly knowing exactly where something is on the page as well as a rough idea of how many pages back in my notebook it is. This helps me find things in my notebook faster than I can usually find them on a phone.</p>

<h2>Having everything in one place</h2>

<p>While it can be convenient to have everything you need on your phone, this convenience rears its ugly head when you get on your phone to figure out what you should spend your time on next, only to end up getting sucked down a rabbit hole, and not even realize what happened until you find yourself an hour or so later scrolling through some form of social media. I have to admit, those companies that make phone apps really know what they're doing, but holy crap I hate it!</p>

<p>By moving your task management system off your phone and into a notebook, you free yourself from having to open your phone whenever you want to check your to-do list. Being productive shouldn't have anything to do with checking your phone. A notebook can protect you from the distractions of technology, while providing you with an endless source of good things to spend your time doing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After spending several years of my life trying to manage my life with various digital systems, I've arrived at this conclusion: digital "productivity" systems are actually just "procrastination" systems in disguise. For many people, the system becomes more of a hobby than a help. This was certainly true in my case. To truly increase my effectiveness, I had to embrace a more boring, simple, and inconvenient system that made it uncomfortably obvious to me that all I was really doing was avoiding tasks instead of actually getting them done. Switching to a notebook was what ultimately took away the digital conveniences that were enabling my laziness.</p
