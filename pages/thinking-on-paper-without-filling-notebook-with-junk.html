<h1>How to externalize your thoughts onto paper without filling your notebooks with junk</h1>

<p class="date">Jan 3, 2026</p>

<p>A problem that any regular user of a notebook would eventually encounter, as I have recently, is that there's a constant trade-off between being able to freely express one's thoughts for the purpose of clear thinking, and making the notebook something worth keeping.</p>

<p>I recently watched an interview with Sam Altman where he explained to the interviewer that he uses a pocket-sized spiral-bound notebook so that he can freely rip out pages, lay them out so he can see them all at once, and throw them away. When he's finished with a notebook, all the pages are gone!</p>

<p>Inspired by the flexibility of such an approach, I experimented with the technique for a few days just to get a feel for it. Not only did I really like the freedom of laying the pages out in front of me, I also liked that since each paper was only a temporary medium, I experienced fewer mental barriers to spilling my thoughts onto the paper.</p>

<p>I also realized that by using a more temporary medium to hash out my messy thoughts, I saved my primary notebook from becoming filled with nonsense.</p>
