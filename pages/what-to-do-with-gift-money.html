<h1>What To Do With Gift Money</h1>

<p class="date">Dec 26, 2024</p>

<p>There are a few issues at play when someone gives gift money instead of a gift. First, they might not know what to even get you. Second, money is a boring gift for them to watch you open, so they might not feel as satisfied having given you a gift. And third, there's no way for them to know for sure that you spent the money on something more interesting than groceries and gas (and maybe you did).</p>

<p>How can these issues be solved? The answer is simple. Find a gift to buy for yourself using the money they gave you, and send them a thank-you message to let them know what you used the money for.</p>

<p>This not only keeps you accountable to use the money on something they would be proud to hear about, it also helps them feel like giving you the money was worth it. This technique also might help them learn what sorts of things you might actually want in the future.</p>
