I discovered the power of the ancient writing system used by our ancestors. Now I can write faster.

My mom's interest in caligraphy is probably what motivated her to teach us the basics of cursive when we were young. However, when it actually came time to writing anything by hand, printing seemed easier to me, so that's what I did. But even though I never used cursive, there were a couple of my letters that resembled their cursive equivilants.

Only a few months ago, I found myself frequently jotting things down in a pocketbook, and was growing more annoyed not only by the time it took to write by hand, but also by the need to lift the pen between each letter. Lifting the pen often is fine when you're writing on a hard surface, but not when you're holding a small journal in your hands without anything stiff to support it. The distance that the pen needs to move to bring it back and forth between not touching the page at all and touching the page with enough force to make a solid line is too large to repeat so frequently without some frustration. It was only a matter of time before I started to grow more curious about the writing technique that until these days was so popular.

After reminding myself how to write some of the more strange-looking cursive letters, I decided that from that moment onward I would only use cursive. It was only a couple weeks before I was quite comfortable with cursive. As I continued to practice, my speed increased, and I quickly surpassed my original printing speed. I can see now why everyone used cursive back in the day: not only is it significantly faster, its flowing nature makes it feel so much nicer to use! I could never go back, and I would recommend readers to do themselves a favor and make the switch.
