We already know writing things by hand helps us remember them, but what are some practical ways we can use that to our advantage outside of meetings or classrooms?

I used to only use digital tools to keep track of my schedule and to-do's, but I discovered that I was never able to remember my schedule, and I always had to check my phone to remind myself. Once I started beginning each day by checking my calendar and handwriting some information about that day's schedule, I discovered that I usually didn't even have to check my handwritten notes as the day went on. The act of creating the notes put my schedule into my brain. That's when I realized the value of writing things down by hand, if only for the purpose of storing them in my head better.

I now use handwritten notes to solidify my memory of not only my schedule, but also my to-do list, names and details of people I meet or interact with, and the thoughts I think throughout the week. I try to handwrite any random pieces of information that I would like to have a better memory of.
